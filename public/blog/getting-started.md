# Getting Started with Coffee Brew Calculator

Welcome to Coffee Brew Calculator! This guide will help you get started with brewing the perfect cup of coffee.

## Step 1: Choose Your Brewing Method

We support five popular brewing methods: Pour Over, French Press, Espresso, Cold Brew, and AeroPress. Each method has its own optimal coffee-to-water ratio.

## Step 2: Set Your Coffee Amount

Use the slider to set how much coffee you want to use. A good starting point is 15-20 grams for a single cup.

## Step 3: Adjust to Your Taste

Use the strength selector to fine-tune the ratio. Light gives you a milder cup, while Strong produces a more intense flavor.

## Step 4: Use the Timer

Our built-in timer is pre-set for each brewing method. Start it when you begin brewing and you'll get a notification when it's time to stop.

## Step 5: Save Your Favorites
